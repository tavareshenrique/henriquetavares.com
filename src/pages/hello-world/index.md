spoiler: Welcome to my Public Evernote

## Heeeeeey Codeeers!!

Welcome to my blog, this is where I will gather some information that I have learned, am learning and working on, trying to try to contribute to the developer community in some way.

## Without PaperW

I like to name my blog evernote public. The reason is that everything I studied and worked on I write in my personal [Evernote](https://evernote.com)

So, all the information I need or until a friend needs it, I consult on my Private Evernote or my [Github](https://github.com/tavareshenrique).

In an attempt to gather all this information in one place, to make it easier not only for my life but for those who may need it, that's how henriquetavares.com came about.

## Who am I?
---
I'm Henrique, I'm a passionate developer of Javascript and the entire ecosystem around these technologies. Currently I have been studying and working with JavaScript, being more specific, working and studying the ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS stacks, but I want to talk about everything I am learning and it is not just a technology.

## Honorable Mention
---
This blog was developed using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and was inspired by the [Dan Abramov's blog](https://overreacted.io). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with some minor tweaks from me.

## Finishing

I update the blog whenever possible, I leave below my social networks to contact.
